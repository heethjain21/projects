### Background

- In Grade 11th, we were introduced to Logarithms and Log Book and the process of calculation seemed lengthy. So I decided to make an app for this. Log Book Maths was then created.

- Since I knew Java, and always wanted to make an Android app, I decided an Android app on mobile would be the best option to move forward with it. I started learning Android Development, and in a few months, the app was ready. The UI was very childish and raw, but I still launched it to Play Store.
  
- I constantly worked on improving the app's UI and fixing bugs reported by the user. Later in 3rd year of college, I made the app again from scratch with new polished UI and dealing with edge cases (which I hadn't dealt with earlier) like using BigInteger/BigDecimal for extremely large numbers, and adding other features like the ability to round off the answer to X numbers after the decimal.
  
- The app currently has 1500+ active installations & 20000+ downloads and a 4.6/5 rating.
